# ToDoTest

# Make sure that you have node.js installed
# Run "npm install" command
# In order to run tests run command "npm run test"

# Note
This is a prototype of the test project, as wasn't plenty of time, page model wasn't used. For me was not clear how to store UI and API tests so I keep them in the same repository. Have a question is you expect to use "Cucumber studio"?
